	<h1>about</h1>
	<img src=https://github.com/savar95x.png height=300px align=right></img>
	<p>Hey there! I'm savar, a nineteen year lad in India, currently <s>pursuing</s> doing electrical engineering from IIT Madras. Passionately, I'm a natural bodybuilder (no, I'm not Arnold, but I'm still very passionate about building a great physique), a free software and linux enthusiast, and a cinema lover.</p>
	<p>In my free time, I often find myself either learning about programming in natural bodybuilding, or building pages for this website.</p>
	<p>A person without a holistic philosophy for life and an ideal to strive for is not living, just existing. A person without that is seriously robbed to me, as he or she is a slave to their cravings, and not the master of their lives. Therefore, in near future, I plan to broaden my mind by exposing myself to great texts written by the likes of neitzsche, jung, and even some biblical scriptures to learn the why of our existence.</p>
	<p>I love to workout. I don't do it for the health benefits, I like pushing myself and that's why I do it, and I train for the sole reason of aesthetics, a purely bodybuilding approach. I train to be great, no matter how hard it gets.</p>
	<p>In terms of actually taking care of myself, I try to meditate everyday, and I mew.<br>Hopefully, with this blog, I'll be able to vent my thoughts out and articulate my thinking and writing, giving me some peace. As it is said by Jordan Peterson, <blockquote>If you can think, write, and speak, and you are absolutely deadly.</blockquote></p>
