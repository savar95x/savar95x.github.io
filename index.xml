      <description>This is a list of movies dear to my heart, and I&#39;d recommend everyone to watch these atleast once in their lifetimes.&#xA;Dead Poets Society (1989)&#xA;08 January 2024 I love this movie, and it feels good to watch it every single time. It teaches a lot about life. Having thoughts of your own, having an identity in this world of rat race. Not to lose yourself in the crowd, but to take stand for yourself and figure out what we really want.</description>

      <description>My attempt at programming a workout plan for myself as a novice.&#xA;This is written based on the information from the following videos by Natural Hypertrophy (NH). How to never have to buy a training program again in your life How to program your training yourself Exercise Selection According to NH, selecting the lifts should be the first priority because that is what essentially makes the skeleton of the program.</description>
