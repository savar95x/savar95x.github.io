It is fine if you don&rsquo;t have one when you begin to workout, we all start coming just out of curisity, but in the long run, when times get tough, this is what&rsquo;ll separate the greats from the goods.</p><blockquote><p>He who has a why can bear almost any how.<br>~ Neitsche</p></blockquote><p>I am not gonna tell what your reason could be. It has to be personal and has to be weird and childish, the kind people laugh at when you tell them.<br>For example, for me, one of the biggest motivators of not giving in is because that is what my younger self would have wanted, to have a physique sculpted by gods themselves. And that I want to become someone kids get inspired to become.</p><p>No amount heartbreak or hatred for oneself or others can give you the drive comparable to something as personal as your <em>why</em>.</p><p>All that being said, it is sometimes important to just fucking do it without any reasons, just because it is good for you. It&rsquo;ll save you a lot of time when you don&rsquo;t really have a solid reason to be consistent, but still make progress to crescendo into your reason when you find one.</p><h2 id=ending-thoughts>Ending thoughts</h2><p>We all begin comming to the gym in the hopes of impressing the girl that we like, but this is far more than that.<br>Going consistently to the gym is a testament of your discipline, dedication and commitment to improving yourself and making yourself better, which is way more deserving of respect and applause than doing it to show off to others.</p><p style=padding-top:1rem><strong><span style=margin-right:.1rem class="ph-bold ph-arrow-left"></span> <a class=invert-underline href=../../../workout-beginners>Back to main page</a></strong></p><i>This page was last edited on 01 Feb 2025 at 02:35 pm</i></section></section></main><br><hr><footer><section><section><span>&copy; 2025</span></section><section class=stuff><a aria-label="source code" href=https://github.com/savar95x/savar95x.github.io>Source</a></section></section></footer></body></html>
