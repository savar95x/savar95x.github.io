	<h1>Movies<br><span> 08 January 2024</span></h1>
	<p>
This is a list of movies dear to my heart, and I'd recommend everyone to watch these atleast once in their lifetimes.<br>
</p>
<h2>Dead Poets Society (1989)<br><span class="fg-alt">08 January 2024<span></h2>
<p>
I love this movie, and it feels good to watch it every single time. It teaches a lot about life. Having thoughts of your own, having an identity in this world of rat race. Not to lose yourself in the crowd, but to take stand for yourself and figure out what we really want.<br>
I love the message behind the film. In the movie, students are encouraged to think for themselves and actually <strong>learn</strong> something from education, and not just accept what's being told to them. They are encouraged to be free thinkers.<br>
It is also told that we all, no matter how great we may think of ourselves or how big our ambitions might be, will eventually die and become part of manure. Therefore, it is important to be in the moment and seize the day, or our life may disappear before our eyes in a blink's time. This notion becomes even more important in the current era, where people scroll their lives away on smartphones. I personally believe smartphones make people dumb(er), but I digress.<br>
It also touches a bit on politics, on how some poeple in power don't like others to think freely, and value only that improves the reputation of their institutes. This a must watch feel-good spectacular masterpiece, filled with quotables, that teaches about the importance of one's individuality and his/her dreams.<br>
All that being said, we know we don't watch movies to learn moral values. We watch them to appreciate art, and this piece of work is an excellent example of how a movie with a story line as simple as this one, can still make an impact.
