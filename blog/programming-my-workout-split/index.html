	<h1>Programming a Workout Split<br><span> 08 January 2024</span></h1>
	<p>
My attempt at programming a workout plan for myself as a novice.<br>
This is written based on the information from the following videos by Natural Hypertrophy (NH).
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li><a target=_blank href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWdAfpJIXbc>How to never have to buy a training program again in your life</a></li>
	<li><a target=_blank href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlWIogS2Qho>How to program your training yourself</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Exercise Selection</h2>
<p>According to NH, selecting the lifts should be the first priority because that is what essentially makes the skeleton of the program. He also advices that the lifts:
<ul>
	<li>should work for the individual's anatomy</li>
	<li>should be already practiced by the individual for atleast 3 months, and seen some growth on</li>
	<li>should be likeable by the individual, do not include it if you don't like it</li>
	<li>as a novice, the program should have very less hard variations to avoid wasting time on neurological adaptation, as you don't <i>need</i> many variations at this point to grow. however, soft variations have no restriction.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Considering all these points, here is a selection of exercises i'd like to keep (this is personal, but consider it an example):</p>
<h3>Arms</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Triceps</strong></li>
	Skull Crusher (Overhead)
	<li><strong>Biceps</strong></li>
	Barbell Curl
</ul>
<h3>Delt</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Side Delt</strong></li>
	Lying Lateral Raise
	<li><strong>Rear Delt</strong></li>
	Reverse Pec Deck
	<li><strong>Front Delt</strong></li>
	Seated Smith Machine OHP
</ul>
<h3>Torso</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Back</strong></li>
	Barbell Row<br>
	Dumbbell Row<br>
	Pulldown (Supinated)<br>
	Cable Pullover
	<li><strong>Chest</strong></li>
	Incline Barbell Bench Press
</ul>
<h3>Legs</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hamstrings</strong></li>
	Romanian Deadlift
	Seated Leg Curl
	<li><strong>Quadriceps</strong></li>
	High Bar Squats
	Leg Press / Smith Machine Hack Squat
</ul>
<h3>Abs, Calves, Traps</h3>
Decline Sit-ups
Standing Calf Raises, Seated Calf Raises
DB Shrugs
<p>
Neck and forearms are not trained directly.<br>
Out of all of these, I've not tried smith machine hack squat and smith machine OHP, but rest other i've done for quiet some time now (except DB rows).
</p>
<h2>Split</h2>
<p>Now, according to NH, either full body or PPL are the best ones for people new to programming, as they are easier to program. But objectively, in the long run, he recommends the gentleman split, which is essentially a 4/5 day upper-lower split programmed very leniently, that is, upper-lower is a guideline but you can do whatever you'd like to (wanna train hamms on upper? go ahead, it's you're split). But, because of it's flexibility, it is somewhat hard to program, escpecially for beginners, hence his previous recommendation.</p>
<p>He trains using supersets, hence his workouts, I suspect, wouldn't take more than an hour and a half to complete. I would love to train that way, and that is how I train right now in my vacays. But this program i'm making is for when i'm in college, where it's virtually impossible to do supersets, especially in the evening. Therefore what i plan on doing is to train both in the morning and in the evening. Doing that, i'll have double the number of sessions in hand, I can spend less that 1 hr each time, doing just one superset but with good focus. Compare that to what i was doing previously, 3hr per session, 6 days per week, 20+ sets every muscle group. Ridiculous.</p>
<p>Anyway, a workout split is essentially just the distribution of lifts, and frequency, volume and intensity of training and muscle across a week's time, hence this is what i'd be doing.</p>
<p>Before I type that out, my emphasis is on these muscle groups.
<ol>
	<li>Arms --> train arms whenever they recover, accumulate only quality work</li>
	<li>Side > rear > front delts --> side delts get trained first in the session, rear and front delt get direct work, not necessarily in the start of a session</li>
	<li>Lats --> a lot of db rows and verticle pulls and pullovers</li>
</ol>
Other than that, every muscle group gets trained atleast twice per week.<br>
And just to be clear, even though i might be in the gym twice the time as nh (though still less than my previous time lmao), I am not necessarily training double as him because i don't have a choice but to not do supersets.  
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Upper - torso and shoulders</li>
	<li>Lower - arms and side delts and legs (easy)</li>
	<li>Rest</li>
	<li>Upper - shoulders and arms</li>
	<li>Lower - legs (hard)</li>
	<li>Upper - torso and arms</li>
	<li>Rest</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li>chindown, incline bb bp, db pullover, sm ohp, rev pec dec</li>
	<li>lateral raise, skull crusher ss bb curl, leg press, rdl</li>
	<li>rest</li>
	<li>sm ohp, rev pec dec, db pullover, lateral raise, skull crusher ss bb curl</li>
	<li>squat, leg curl</li>
	<li>db row, incline bb bp, db pullover, lateral raise, skull crusher ss bb curl</li>
	<li>rest</li>
</ol>
<p><s>I'll update the sets and the reps later on.</s></p>
<p>
<strong>10 Jan 2024</strong><br>
In theory, the written out program looks good, every muscle group gets hit atleast twice, and we're not being in the gym for ridiculous amounts of time. But, I still feel like we're underestimating our ability to train arms, as I've realised in my last workout session that doing pulldowns right after bicep curls is a viable option when prioritising arms. Apart from that, I havn't run this program practically, and therefore can't speak of it's credibility, and how well I'd respond to it.<br>
Also, I wanna explore lower reps in my next workout plan; Thanks to science-based gurus, I've been training at a high volume high frequency (with moderate to high intensity) ever since I started training in the gym, without actually taking the time to listen to my body. Without trying to figure out what works best for me. I did grow in my previous methodology, but I would have grown on whatever, considering how newbie I am. Maybe, I could have had the same amount of gains training half the volume I did. I say this because, in the last few sessions, I trained close to failure in the 6-10 rep range (in Barbell bench press), and got negligible pump. I mean there was a pump, but negligible compared to what I would have earlier, when I used to do just 4 sets of 6-10 dips. It might be because I've become less of a newbie and just anything doesn't work anymore, but it also might be that my body likes dips better. Who knows, I never stopped and took the time to think abou that.<br>
<p>
One thing in my journey that I've realised is that muscle building and physique strivation is a very gradual process. You cannot rush it. You've got to meditate, instrospect, and listen to you body. And not cuss yourself for not being jacked enough as that other dude on Instagram.<br>
Nothing can fill the gap created by inconsistency, and nothing can shortcut you're way to success. You have got to go through journey, go through the emotions, be with yourself in your highs <em>and</em> your lows.<br>
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
I just realised this became very philosophical very quickly. But honestly, I don't even know what I am doing, and how <em>anything</em> is even working. Whatever I did till now was based on the general scientific findings, and I know absolutely nothing about what makes my body respond well, except what movements I like out of the few ones that I've done.<br>
So, to conclude this discussion, I'll say that I'm not experience enough to make a program for myself, and expect it to work well. The next few weeks, I will experiment with what works for me, what I perosanally like, and also learn the various methodologies and philosophies people have about training, as natural bodybuilders. I've spent a lot of time watching NH, but that all is in bits and pieces. Heck man I don't even know what to answer if someone asks me what actually builds muscle. What I really should be doing is watching long lectures on natural bodybuilding instead of short form videos. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwXDP1PfvIM>This</a> video from BaldOmniMan is in my radar for now. I'll write a good article on the same topic, some time form now, weeks, months, years, I don't know, whenever I feel like I am knowledgable enough to comment on the topic and give advice to novices. Till then, I'll keep updating what I actually do in my workouts over <a href=/archive/workouts/current/>here</a>.
