	<p>
This is a list of movies dear to my heart, and I'd recommend everyone to watch these atleast once in their lifetimes.<br>
</p>
<h3>Dead Poets Society (1989)</h3>
<p>
<strong>08 January 2024</strong><br>
I love this movie, and it feels good to watch it every single time. It teaches a lot about life. Having thoughts of your own, having an identity in this world of rat race. Not to lose yourself in the crowd, but to take stand for yourself and figure out what we really want.<br>
I love the message behind the film. In the movie, students are encouraged to think for themselves and actually <strong>learn</strong> something from education, and not just accept what's told to them. They are told to be free thinkers.<br>
It is also told that we all, no matter how great we may think of ourselves or how big out ambitions may be, will eventually die and become part of manure. It is important to be in the moment and seize the day, or our life may slide before our eyes. This thought becomes even more important in the current era, where people scroll their lives away on smartphones. I personally believe smartphones make people dumb, but I digress.<br>
It also touches a bit on politics, on how some poeple in power don't like others to think freely, and value only that improves the reputation of their institutes.<br>
All in all, this a must watch feel-good spectacular masterpiece of a movie, filled with quotables, that teaches about the importance of one's individuality and his/her dreams.
