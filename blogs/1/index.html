	<h1>programming my workout split</h1>
	<p>My attempt at programming a workout plan for myself as a novice.</p>
<h2>exercise selection</h2>
<p>According to NH, selecting the lifts should be the first priority because that is what essentially makes the skeleton of the program. he also advices that the lifts:
<ul>
	<li>should be work for the individual's anatomy</li>
	<li>should be already practiced by the individual for atleast 3 months, and seen some growth on</li>
	<li>should be likeable by the individual, do not include it if you don't like it</li>
	<li>as a novice, the program should have very less hard variations to avoid wasting time on neurological adaptation, as you don't <i>need</i> many variations at this point to grow. however, soft variations have no restriction.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>considering all these points, here is a selection of exercises i'd like to keep (this is personal, but consider it an example):</p>
<ul>
	<li>arms</li>
	<ul>
		<li>triceps</li>
		skull crusher (overhead)
		<li>bicep</li>
		barbell curl
	</ul>
	<li>delt</li>
	<ul>
		<li>side delt</li>
		lying lateral raise
		<li>rear delt</li>
		reverse pec deck
		<li>front delt</li>
		seated smith machine ohp
	</ul>
	<li>torso</li>
	<ul>
		<li>back</li>
		dumbbell row
		pulldown (supinated)
		db pullover
		<li>chest</li>
		incline barbell bench press
	</ul>
	<li>legs</li>
	<ul>
		<li>hamstrings</li>
		romanian deadlift
		seated leg curl
		<li>quadriceps</li>
		high bar squats
		leg press / smith machine hack squat
	</ul>
	<li>abs, calves, traps</li>
	decline sit-ups
	standing calf raises, seated calf raises
	db shrugs
</ul>
<p>neck and forearms are not trained directly.<br>out of all of these, i've not tried smith machine hack squat and smith machine ohp, but rest other i've done for quiet some time now (except db rows)</p>
<h2>split</h2>
<p>now, according to nh, either full body or ppl are the best ones for people new to programming, as they are easier to program. but objectively, in the long run, he recommends the gentleman split, which is essentially a 4/5 day upper-lower split programmed very leniently, that is, upper-lower is a guideline but you can do whatever you'd like to (wanna train hamms on upper? go ahead, it's you're split). but, because of it's flexibility, it is somewhat hard to program, escpecially for beginners, hence his previous recommendation.</p>
<p>he trains using supersets, hence his workouts, i suspect, wouldn't take more than an hour and a half to complete. i would love to train that way, and that is how i train right now in my vacays. but this program i'm making is for when i'm in college, where it's virtually impossible to do supersets, especially in the evening. therefore what i plan on doing is to train both in the morning and in the evening. doing that, i'll have double the number of sessions in hand, i can spend less that 1 hr each time, doing just one superset but with good focus. compare that to what i was doing previously, 3hr per session, 6 days per week, 20+ sets every muscle group. ridiculous.</p>
<p>anyway, a workout split is essentially just the distribution of lifts, and frequency, volume and intensity of training and muscle across a week's time, hence this is what i'd be doing.</p>
<p>before i type that out, my emphasis is on these muscle groups.
<ol>
	<li>arms -- > train arms whenever they recover, accumulate only quality work</li>
	<li>side > rear > front delts --> side delts get trained first in the session, rear and front delt get direct work, not necessarily in the start of a session</li>
	<li>lats --> a lot of db rows and verticle pulls and pullovers</li>
</ol>
other than that, every muscle group gets trained atleast twice per week.<br>
and just to be clear, even though i might be in the gym twice the time as nh (though still less than my previous time lmao), i am not necessarily training double as him because i don't have a choice but to not do supersets.  
</p>

<ol>
	<li>upper - torso and shoulders</li>
	<li>lower - arms and side delts and legs (easy)</li>
	<li>rest</li>
	<li>upper - shoulders and arms</li>
	<li>lower - legs (hard)</li>
	<li>upper - torso and arms</li>
	<li>rest</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li> chindown, incline bb bp, db pullover, sm ohp, rev pec dec</li>
	<li> lateral raise, skull crusher ss bb curl, leg press, rdl</li>
	<li> rest</li>
	<li> sm ohp, rev pec dec, db pullover, lateral raise, skull crusher ss bb curl</li>
	<li> squat, leg curl</li>
	<li> db row, incline bb bp, db pullover, lateral raise, skull crusher ss bb curl</li>
	<li> rest</li>
</ol>
<p>i'll update the sets and the reps later on.</p>
