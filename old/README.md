# My webpages
This repo is a collection of my web pages :

### Startpage
A startpage for my personal usage.<br>
The src is in testing/

### Great Movies
A simple webpage listing out some good and pointful movies that I have seen (or will see).<br>
Additions to the list would be appreciated.<br>
Don't mind the eyecandy look of it, new design is in works.
